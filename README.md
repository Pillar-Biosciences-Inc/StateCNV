# StateCNV

**A Bayesian State-Space Method for Copy Number Variation Detection and Thalassemia Profiling**

## Summary

This repository provides a full implementation of the method described in the paper:

> *"Classifying Copy Number Variations Using State Space Modeling of Targeted Sequencing Data: A Case Study in Thalassemia"*

We introduce a probabilistic framework for detecting and classifying copy number variation (CNV) profiles from targeted amplicon sequencing data. The method combines state-space modeling, auxiliary particle filtering, and Bayesian decision theory to robustly estimate copy number ratios, assign genetic profiles (e.g., thalassemia subtypes), and detect low-quality clinical samples using Bayesian evidence.
